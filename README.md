# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
### Overview of the Analysis
In this challenge, I help Pewlett Hackard future-proof the company. Because a large number of employees soon become retirement-ready, Bobby's manager has requested to determine the number of retiring employees grouped by their titles and identify the eligible employees to participate in a mentorship program. To prepare these lists, I build the queries in SQL using filters, joins, and functions.
